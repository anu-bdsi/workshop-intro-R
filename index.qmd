## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This is a training workshop for staff and students affiliated with the Australian National University (ANU) offered by the ANU Biological Data Science Institute (BDSI).

The workshop is designed to introduce participants to the fundamentals of using R for basic computations. It is suitable for individuals with no prior experience in R or those seeking a refresher in R. Familiarity with basic summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles, etc.) is assumed. It's important to note that this workshop alone is not sufficient to practice data analysis. Attendees are encouraged to also participate in the Data Wrangling with R (Part 1) and Data Visualization with R (Part 1) workshops to acquire essential skills for contemporary data wrangling and visualization practices.

## Learning objectives
