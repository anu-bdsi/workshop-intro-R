Familiarity with basic summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles, etc.) is assumed. It‚Äôs important to note that this workshop alone is not sufficient to practice data analysis. Attendees are encouraged to also participate in the Data Wrangling with R (Part 1) and Data Visualization with R (Part 1) workshops to acquire essential skills for contemporary data wrangling and visualization practices.\nThis website is brought to you by the ANU Biological Data Science Institute."
