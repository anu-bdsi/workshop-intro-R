## Learning objectives

{{< fa hand-point-right >}} The main aim is for you to get started with using R for basic computations.

## What is R?

::: flex

::: {.w-50}


- **R** is a programming language predominately for data analysis

:::

::: {.w-50 .pl3}

- **RStudio Desktop** is an integrated development environment (**IDE**) that helps you to use R

<center>

## How to use R?

- RStudio Desktop (or RStudio IDE) is the most common way to use R

<center>

![](images/rstudio-desktop-annotation.png){.ba width="75%"}

</center>

- You can type operations directly into the Console pane

## Customise Global Options 

::: flex

::: {.w-50}

- Go to **RStudio** > **Tools** > **Global Options...**
- Under the **General** tab, make sure the "Restore .RData into workspace at startup" is _unticked_.
- This avoids unexpectedly loading (old) data into your workspace and making your code only work in your workspace, but not for others (which is bad reproducible practice).

## R Packages

::: flex

::: {.w-70}

::: incremental

- **R packages** are community developed extensions to R [(much like apps on your mobile)]{.grey}
- The Comprehensive R Archive Network (**CRAN**) is a volunteer maintained repository that hosts submitted R packages that are approved [(much like an app store)]{.grey}
  - There are close to 20,000 packages available on CRAN
  - The qualities of R packages vary 
- There are other repositories that host R packages, e.g. **Bioconductor** for bioinformatics, **R Universe**, **R-Forge**, **GitHub** [(we won't cover these)]{.grey}

## Why learn R?

::: incremental

- **R** is one of the top programming languages for statistics or data science
  - Python is also a good alternative language for data science 
  - _Better to have a mastery of at least one language rather than none_
- R was initially developed by statisticians for statisticians 
  - State-of-the-art statistical methods are generally more readily available in R
- R has an active and friendly community 
- R is a free and open source software (FOSS) 
  - **free** = money is not a barrier to use it
  - **open source software** = transparency

## How to get better at R?

::: incremental

- [PRACTICE]{.f-headline}
- Practice with a purpose (e.g. using R on your own data)
- Try teaching and helping others with their R problem 
- Have a [willingness to _continuously_ learn and adapt]{.f-subheadline}
  - R is an ever evolving language [(check the [release news](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/NEWS.html) every so often)]{.grey}
  - new features and packages are added _very frequently_
  - whether you are a beginner or not, there are always things we do not know about R
- Do you have any strategies or tips? Please share!

## Functions in R 

::: incremental

- There are many functions in R!
- Generally if you need to compute some numerical summary that is common in your field, then there is probably already an existing function in the R ecosystem.
- Try always searching it on a search engine (e.g. Google) with the right keywords. 
- If it's computed from a community contributed R package, then check to see if there's some quality indicators:
  - Is it actively maintained?
  - Is it widely used?
  - Does the package have tests for its functions? Etc.

:::

## Base packages 

::: incremental

- R has 7 packages (`stats`, `graphics`, `grDevices`, `utils`, `datasets`, `methods`, `base`), collectively referred to as the "base packages", that are loaded automatically when you launch it. 
- The functions in the base packages are generally well-tested and trustworthy.

:::


## Artihmetics

- Many of the arithmetic functions come from `base`.
- You can see `library(help = "base")` for indexed help files.

```{r}
#| echo: true
sqrt(3)
abs(-3)
exp(1)
log(4, base = exp(1))
sum(1:3)
```


## Numerical summaries 

- Numerical summaries generally come `base` or `stats` package.
- Some common numerical summaries include:
  - Mean: `mean()`
  - Median: `median()`
  - Five number summary: `fivenum()`
  - Minimum: `min()`
  - Maximum: `max()`
  - Quantile: `quantile()`
  - Correlation coefficient: `cor()`


## Missing values 

::: incremental

- `NA` in R denotes missing values -- there are in fact different types of missing values (`NA_character_`, `NA_integer_`, `NA_real_`, `NA_complex_`).

:::

. . . 

- When there are missing values, it can cause issues in the computation.

```{r}
x <- c(2.3, NA, 4.7)
mean(x)
```

. . . 

- Below we remove the missing values:

```{r}
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

. . . 

- Notice that the above is different to below when there are missing value(s):

```{r}
sum(x, na.rm = TRUE) / length(x)
```


## Some parametric distributions 

- The density (`d`), distribution (`p`) or quantile (`q`) functions of a parametric distribution are generally in the `stats` package.
- There are functions to generate random values from a particular parametric distribution (`r`).

- Some examples are:
