# Workshop materials

All materials will be hosted at<br> [<https://anu-bdsi.github.io/workshop-intro-to-R/>]{.f-subheadline target="_blank"}

## Learning objectives

::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## {{< fa crosshairs >}} Overall goal

Develop skills to work with your research data using R 

:::

Today:

- Setting up your data project (R project, folder structure)
- Reading data into R (csv and xlsx)
- The basics of R programming (atomic vectors, lists, data.frame, subsetting R objects)
- Troubleshooting and producing minimal reproducible examples with `reprex`
- Compute numerical summaries
- Be familiar with computing density, distribution quantile and random generation of some parametric distributions


  
  
## What is R?

::: incremental

- **R** is a programming language predominately for data analysis
- **RStudio Desktop** is an integrated development environment (**IDE**) that helps you to use R
- **R packages** are community developed extensions to R [(much like apps on your mobile)]{.grey}
- The Comprehensive R Archive Network (**CRAN**) is a volunteer maintained repository that hosts submitted R packages that are approved [(much like an app store)]{.grey}
  - There are close to 20,000 packages available on CRAN
  - The qualities of R packages vary 
- There are other repositories that host R packages, e.g. **Bioconductor** for bioinformatics [(we won't cover this)]{.grey}

## How to use R?

- RStudio Desktop (or RStudio IDE) is the most common way to use R

- You can type operations directly into the Console pane

## Why learn R?

::: incremental

- R is one of the top programming languages for statistics or data science
  - Python is also a good alternative language for data science 
  - Better to have a mastery of at least one language rather than none
- R was initially developed by statisticians for statisticians 
  - State-of-the-art statistical methods are generally more readily available in R
- R has an active and friendly community 
- R is a free and open source software (FOSS) 
  - free = money is not a barrier to use it
  - open source software = transparency

## How to get better at R?

::: incremental

- [PRACTICE]{.f-headline}
- Practice with a purpose (e.g. using R on your own data)
- Try teaching and helping others with their R problem 
- Have a [willingness to _continuously_ learn and adapt]{.f-subheadline}
  - R is an ever evolving language [(check the [release news](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/NEWS.html) every so often)]{.grey}
  - new features and packages are added very frequently
  - whether you are a beginner or not, there are always things we do not know about R
- Do you have any strategies or tips? Please share!
