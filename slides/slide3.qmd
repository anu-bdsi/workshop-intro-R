## {{< fa crosshairs >}} Current learning objective

```{r}
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
source("setup.R")
```

::: f2

```{r}
#| results: asis 
#| echo: false

## Data file formats 

::: incremental

- Data are stored as a file, which points to a block of computer memory.
- A file format signals a way to interpret the information stored in the computer memory.
- A file with the extension "csv" (comma-separated values) uses a comma as a delimiter while "tsv" uses tabs as a delimiter. 

:::

```{.markdown filename="data.csv"}
len, supp, dose
4.2, VC, 0.5
11.5, VC, 0.5
...
```


::: notes

- A common approach is to have as a text file format where 
  - a delimiter (e.g. "," and tabs) separate columns,
  - the first row (header) corresponds to the names of the variables, and 
  - subsequent rows correspond to the values.

## Reading CSV files

```{webr-r}
#| context: setup
download.file("https://coatless.github.io/raw-data/Salaries.csv", "data.csv")
dir.create("data")
```

```{webr-r}
dir()
```

- `GRRData.csv`

:::


## Binary or propriety file formats 

::: incremental 

- Data can also be stored as a binary format [(in R, these include `.RData` and `.rda` but we won't cover this)]{.grey}.
- Data can also come in a propriety format (e.g. xls and xlsx) -- these require special ways to open/view/read it.

`template_Morris.xlsx`

## Formatting data

::: incremental

- Unless you are responsible for entering the data, you should never modify the original, stored data [(note: exceptions do apply)]{.grey}.
- For scientific integrity, any modification to the original data should be recorded in a reproducible manner (e.g. by programming in R!) so that you can trace the exact modifications.

:::

## Importing data

- Reading data into R requires using the function that matches with the right file format.

. . . 

- For reading csv file, you can use `readr::read_csv()` (note: `readr` is part of `tidyverse`)

```r
cfdata <- readr::read_csv("complex-formation.csv")
```

. . . 

- For reading excel files, you can use `readxl::read_xlsx`:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| error: true
#| output-location: fragment
kingston <- readxl::read_xlsx("kingston-data.xlsx", sheet = "A")
```

. . . 

- But why the error?!


## File paths

::: flex

::: {.w-60 .pr3}

- Your file has to be in the right location to be read!
- You may use a **relative path** (e.g. `data/data.csv`) or an **absolute path** (e.g. `C:\\user/myproject/data/data.csv`) to point to the right location of the data 
- {{< fa exclamation-triangle >}} You should avoid using absolute path! Why?
- You can get and set the current path using `getwd()` and `setwd()`, respectively.

## Folder structure 

- Your folder structure depends on the project, but it is generally a good idea to have a folder on its own for each project.

. . . 

- Within the project, it is also good to have a separate folder for:
  - data
  - script/analysis
  - report/paper
  - figures/images.

## R project

::: incremental

- Within RStudio, you can create a project file (with an .Rproj extension).
- Double clicking on this project file launches RStudio Desktop with the current working directory set to the location of the project file. 
- You can create this project file by going to RStudio > File > New Project ...
